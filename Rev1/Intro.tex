\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Head models are used in many research areas, including imaging, mesh generation, visualization, and any bioelectric research topic that requires simulations such as forward and inverse problems \cite{ref:Brette2012}. Imaging is necessary for building any head model, and finding a dataset that includes all imaging modalities is rare since most research projects will include only the modalities necessary to the specific project. For each new project a new head model must be built, which is a time-consuming task.

In this project we describe a detailed, comprehensive pipeline to build a complete, high-resolution head model. Steps of the pipeline include image acquisition, preprocessing and registration, image segmentation, finite element mesh generation, simulations, and visualization. This paper describes two three-dimensional tetrahedral finite element meshes of different resolutions that serve as volume conductors to solve the forward problem. The simulations result in visualizations of the forward problem, with isotropic and anisotropic systems; functional image data mapped onto a tetrahedral mesh; electroencephalography (EEG) signals mapped onto net electrodes; and diffusion tensor data. Lastly, we create a complete, high-resolution brain segmentation that can be used to create three-dimensional tetrahedral volume and surface meshes. 

Along with outlining the pipeline, this project will be released as an open-source dataset. The project took roughly a year to complete due to the many options in software and techniques, as well as the complexity of the data. The segmentation of the image data took roughly 100 hours, most being dedicated to manual editing. The mesh generation required several weeks and iterations for an appropriate size without holes. Since the segmentation was complex and high resolution, the tetrahedral meshes became extremely large, which made for very slow simulations. Further simplification methods failed because of the number of different tissues in the head. Registration of diffusion tensor data and functional MR data was difficult because transformations from other software packages were not compatible with the SCIRun problem-solving environment \cite{ref:scirun}, and functional MR data has not previously been used in SCIRun.
