\section*{Abstract}

The beginnings of most simulation-based research, including EEG data, require building an accurate and realistic head and brain volume conductor. Construction of this volume conductor generally follows an image-based modeling pipeline which includes: structural and functional imaging, tissue segmentation, and three-dimensional meshing. The results from this pipeline are then used in simulations, along with EEG data, and visualizations. Currently, the process of building head and brain models is not automated and not necessarily straightforward. In this paper, we provide a detailed, reproducible head and brain modeling pipeline and a high-resolution, freely available, multi-modal,  female dataset which expands the diversity and availability of data in the EEG research area. The dataset includes the results at each stage of the model-building process as well as all necessary components for running simulations and visualizations. The availability of this pipeline and dataset will help further neuroscience research with more efficiency.
