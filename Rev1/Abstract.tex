\section*{Abstract}

To conduct computational forward and inverse EEG studies of brain electrical activity, researchers must construct realistic head and brain computer models. Constructing such models is challenging and time consuming. The availability of realistic head models and corresponding imaging data is limited in terms of both imaging modalities and patient diversity. In this paper, we describe a detailed head modeling pipeline and provide a high-resolution, multimodal, open-source, female head and brain model. The modeling pipeline specifically outlines image acquisition, preprocessing, registration, and segmentation; three-dimensional tetrahedral mesh generation; finite element EEG simulations; and visualization of the model and simulation results. The dataset includes both functional and structural images and EEG recordings from two high-resolution electrode configurations. The results at each stage of the model building process and necessary software components are included for performing simulations and visualizations. This project will contribute to neuroscience research by providing a high-quality dataset that can be used for a variety of applications and a computational pipeline that may help researchers construct new head models more efficiently.
