\section*{Abstract}

To conduct computational studies of the brain, researchers must construct realistic head and brain computer models to simulate electrical activity. Construction of these models is challenging and time consuming. Availability of datasets to build these models is limited both in terms of imaging modalities and diversity of the patient. In this paper, we provide a detailed head and brain modeling pipeline and a high-resolution, multi-modal, freely available, female dataset, which expands the diversity and availability of computer brain models and simulation data. The modeling pipeline specifically outlines image acquisition, preprocessing, registration, and segmentation; three-dimensional, finite element, tetrahedral mesh generation; EEG simulations; and visualization. The dataset includes both functional and structural imaging, as well as EEG recordings from two different high resolution electrode configurations. The results at each stage of the model-building process are included as well as all necessary components for running simulations and visualizations. The availability of this project will help further neuroscience research by providing a high quality test dataset that can be used for a variety of applications, and a pipeline that may help researchers construct new head models more efficiently.
