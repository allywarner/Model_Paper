                 similar sequence of processing steps, starting from images

                 of tissue properties, numerical simulation and
                 visualization of the results-a process known as
                 image-based geometric modelling and simulation. We present
                 an overview of software systems for implementing such a
                 sequence both within highly integrated problem-solving
                 environments and in the form of loosely integrated
                 pipelines. Loose integration in this case indicates that
                 individual programs function largely independently but
                 communicate through files of a common format and support
                 simple scripting, so as to automate multiple executions
                 wherever possible. We then describe three specific
                 applications of such pipelines to translational biomedical
                 research in electrophysiology.",
