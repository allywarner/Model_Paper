\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}


In this project, we have described a comprehensive pipeline to build an inhomogeneous, anisotropic head and brain model based on human data of multiple image modalities for use in electroencephalography with an emphasis on forward and inverse problem research, as well as visualizations of functional MRI and EEG data. Along with the pipeline, we have released the example subject data as open-source to enable other scientists to have a starting point and a straightforward path for further research. The high-resolution, multi-image dataset is available in parts for those who want to use only specific aspects of the project.
