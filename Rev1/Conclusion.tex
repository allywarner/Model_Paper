\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper we have outlined a comprehensive pipeline to build an inhomogeneous, anisotropic head and brain model based on human data of all image modalities for use in electroencephalography with an emphasis in forward and inverse problem research as well as visualizations of function MRI data and EEG data. Along with the pipeline, the human data will be released as open-source to enable other scientists to have a starting point to continue further research. 

Further investigations from building this pipeline include finding better decimation algorithms for 3D tetrahedral finite element meshes. Due to the number of materials included in the mesh, current decimation algorithms have not been able to further simplify the mesh. More inclusive methods for functional MRI data into a source localization head model. More specific processing of EEG data for different applications which will make for better visualization.
